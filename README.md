# Face-And-Eyes-Recognition-In-Matlab
Our system of face detection using MATLAB can detect not only just human face but also eyes. Basically face detection is the process of detecting one or more human faces in real-time videos.
In this project we have learnt that it is easy and simple task for humans to identify
faces than computers. In this field there is a large variation caused by
expressions or facial appearance. We have used Graphic User Interface(GUI)
which allows us to choose between detection of face and eyes.

# Face-And-Eyes-Recognition-In-Matlab
Our system of face detection using MATLAB can detect not only just human face but also eyes. Basically face detection is the process of detecting one or more human faces in real-time videos.

It is very easy and simple task for humans to identify faces than computers. In this field there is a large variation caused by expressions or facial appearance. So, I have build a computer system to detect the face and eyes of the end-user. 

I have used the Voila-jones algorithm in this project. I have used a function called **vision.CascadeObjectDetector** is used to detect objects using Voila Jones algorithm. This fuction can detect face, eyes, nose mouth or upper body of the user. In this project we are just detecting face and eyes of the person. The only negative point of this algorithm is it takes more time in training and detects the objects fast.

We have used Graphic User Interface(GUI) which allows us to choose between detection of face and eyes.
